1. Copy file between Local System and Docker:
		1a. docker ps: View Container ID
		1b. docker cp <Localfile> <Container ID:DockerLocation>

2. Run docker
		$ docker run -it <Name> /bin/bash
 
3. Run any command in a running container just knowing its ID (or name):
		$ docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> echo "Hello from container!"

4. If the container is currently stopped, you need to first run it with the following command:
		$ docker start <container-name/ID>
		$ docker exec -it <container-name/ID> bash

5. Stop A container:
		$ docker stop <container-name/ID>
